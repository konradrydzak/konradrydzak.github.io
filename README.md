# [konradrydzak.github.io](https://konradrydzak.github.io/)

My personal website with [***Blog***](https://konradrydzak.github.io/) posts (about my projects, skills, lessons learned, and courses completed) as well as an [***About me***](https://konradrydzak.github.io/about) section and [***Contact***](https://konradrydzak.github.io/contact) info.  
The blog content on the site is easily [***searchable***](https://konradrydzak.github.io/search).  

This website serves as a place for my additional thoughts and comments on my portfolio, and I think it's a nice addition to the resume. ðŸ“‹

## Skills used

- set up a GitHub Page for my profile (based on [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart))
- recreating the [Sidey jekyll theme](https://github.com/ronv/sidey)
- using HTML, CSS and JS for building pages
- writing Markdown files for pages and blog posts
- generating website with jekyll (by jekyll and bundler gems, jekyll plugins, etc.)
- providing JSON, XML and RSS feeds
- set up a sitemap.xml, robots.txt file for site indexing (*you can now search for my website on Google!*)
- optimised the site to get a perfect **4x100/100** score on Google PageSpeed Insights, both on [desktop](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-konradrydzak-github-io/l4m52u9rol?form_factor=desktop) and [mobile](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-konradrydzak-github-io/l4m52u9rol?form_factor=mobile)!
