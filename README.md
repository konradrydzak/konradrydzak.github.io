# [konradrydzak.github.io](https://konradrydzak.github.io/)

My personal website with [***Blog***](https://konradrydzak.github.io/) posts (about my projects, skills, lessons learned, and courses completed) and also an [***About me***](https://konradrydzak.github.io/about) section and [***Contact***](https://konradrydzak.github.io/contact) info.  
The blog content on the site is easily [***searchable***](https://konradrydzak.github.io/search).  

This website serves as a place for my additional thoughts and comments on my portfolio, and I think it's a nice addition to the resume. ðŸ“‹

## Skills used

- set up a GitHub Page for my profile (based on [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart))
- recreating of the [Sidey jekyll theme](https://github.com/ronv/sidey)
- using HTML, CSS and JS for building pages

### Possible improvements

- add `tags` to blog posts (disabled for now, because as far as I know Sidey jekyll theme uses **hardcoded** tags)
- provide JSON, XML and RSS feeds
- set up a robots.txt file for site indexing (not applicable without XML and sitemap.xml)
