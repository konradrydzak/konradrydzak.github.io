Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to start using this GitHub Page for blogging but first things first, 
let me tell you about the process I went through to get this site up and running.  

### Following the GitHub Pages Documentation

To begin my journey, I turned to the [official GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart). 
The GitHub Pages Quickstart tutorial provided a solid foundation and step-by-step instructions for getting started. 
The documentation covers everything from creating a repository to configuring settings and deploying your site. 
If you're new to GitHub Pages, I highly recommend checking out this extensive guide.

### Using the Sidey Jekyll Blog Theme

For the design of my personal website, I decided to use the Sidey Jekyll blog theme. 
Created by [Ronv](https://github.com/ronv), Sidey offers an elegant and minimalist design that perfectly suits my vision. 
The theme has a simple, clean design and focuses on presenting material in a user-friendly way.  
Setup is not that intuitive, in fact copying/forking everything from [Sidey GitHub repository](https://github.com/ronv/sidey/tree/master) is probably the easiest way. 
While some customization may require a deeper understanding, you can experiment and modify the theme to your liking through trial and error. For example, I've removed tags for blog posts and temporarily disabled certain feeds such as JSON, XML, and RSS.  
Overall, using Sidey allows me to focus on writing and sharing my thoughts, while the theme takes care of the overall presentation and layout of my blog posts. It's a great way to present my content in a professional and aesthetically pleasing way.  
Additionally, this website serves as a place for my additional thoughts and comments on my portfolio, making it a valuable addition to my resume. ðŸ“‹
