I know I need to learn more about HTML, CSS, Javascript to use them effectively combined, but for learning? They are definitely not equal for me:</p><ul><li>Javascript? I get it, it‚Äôs just another scripting language.</li><li>HTML? Okay, I understand the syntax and I know the basics.</li><li>but CSS? Please no, that monstrosity is scary!</li></ul><h3 id="what-to-do-what-to-do">What to do? What to do‚Ä¶</h3><p>As I‚Äôve written before, the best learning comes from sources that are: easy to read and understand, are short/have small split sections and are interactive.</p><p>But what if you reeeeeeealy don‚Äôt like learning that particular thing (CSS üëÄ)? Here comes procrastination! But we can use it, and bend it our way.</p><p>I‚Äôm talking about playing games.</p><blockquote><p>Yes, sometimes instead of cleaning the apartment all I can think about is that I‚Äôd love to play a video game right now. And in my opinion, the same mindset and strategy can be used to learn hard things.</p></blockquote><p>Here I‚Äôm going to list some fun games to help you learn CSS that you can play in your browser:</p><h3 id="css-diner"><a href="http://cssdiner.com">CSS Diner</a></h3><p>A visually appealing way to learn the basics of CSS selectors. Works smoothly and beating each level feels great. It‚Äôs so clever what Luke Pacholski (<a href="https://github.com/flukeout/css-diner">GitHub</a>) has done, and I think it‚Äôs a prime example of what can be done to make learning more fun.</p><p>Now go and clear out some plates! üçΩÔ∏è</p><h3 id="flexbox-defence"><a href="http://www.flexboxdefense.com/">Flexbox Defence</a></h3><p>A tower defense game with a twist: all towers must be positioned with CSS flexbox.</p><p>Now that‚Äôs a proper game! Who doesn‚Äôt like to play a tower defense game? I‚Äôm trully amazed by the fact that you can teach CSS things like: <em>justify-content</em>, <em>align-items</em>, <em>flex-direction</em>, <em>order</em> and <em>align-self</em> in such a way.</p><p>There is no stopping in learning CSS when you can stop the incoming enemies from getting past your defenses!</p><h3 id="flexbox-froggy-and-grid-garden"><a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a> and <a href="https://cssgridgarden.com/">Grid Garden</a></h3><p><a href="https://codepip.com/about/">Codepip</a> has a few educational games up its sleeve. The two mentioned here are free to play: Flexbox Froggy is another game for learning CSS flexbox and Grid Garden teaches about <del>watering crops</del> CSS grid.</p><p>Instructions are clear, gameplay is smooth and so is the learning process involved. I really enjoyed going through all the levels of both of these games.</p><p><br /></p><blockquote><p>Since today is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Day">Children‚Äôs Day in Poland</a>, I hope you‚Äôll have fun and feel like a kid (not by getting angry about having to learn, but) playing the games listed above. Happy coding! ü•≥</p></blockquote><span class="meta"><time datetime="2023-06-01T00:00:00+02:00">1 June, 2023</time></span></section></main></body></html>
