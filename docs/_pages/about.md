### Hi, I'm Konrad! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Python developer, currently working on web scraping, data collection and process re-creation mechanisms using various airline websites and APIs.  
I have about 2 years of work experience, am still eager to learn new things and try to broaden my tech stack.  

On this blog page I try to summarize my projects, skills I've acquired, lessons I've learned and courses I've completed (with my thoughts about them).  
Occasionally, I'll write a few little tech notes for my future self. ðŸ˜‰
